# VLLM Eval

We made some changes to vLLM here: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/17520

The benchmarks folder contains the changes to the benchmarks folder in vLLM, and the script files were used to run the loops against datasets to get results. 

The actual datasets were downloaded from huggingface
- https://huggingface.co/datasets/galileo-ai/agent-leaderboard/tree/main 
- https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered/blob/main/ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json

The datasets are not included here for size constraints
